    NgVerse is a collection of feature-rich Angular components, directives,
    pipes, and more. It has one key difference from other UI libraries:
    <strong>you donâ€™t install it as a dependency</strong>. Instead, you add the
    source code of the elements directly into your project.
  </p>

  <h2>What does that mean?</h2>

  <p>
    Typically, when you use a UI library, you install the library as a
    dependency and then import components from it. NgVerse is different. You
    install the NgVerse schematics and selectively add the components you need.
    The component's source code is injected into your project, making it
    <strong>fully customizable</strong>. You can explore, update, or leave it as
    is.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, if you were using a traditional Angular UI library, the steps
    would look like this:
  </p>
  <doc-source-code
    language="bash"
    code="npm install angular-ui-library"
  ></doc-source-code>

  <p>And to use a button component:</p>
  <doc-source-code
    language="bash"
    code="import { ButtonComponent } from 'angular-ui-library'"
  ></doc-source-code>

  <p>In the case of NgVerse, the process is different:</p>

  <h3>1. Install NgVerse schematics:</h3>
  <doc-source-code language="bash" code="ng add ngverse"></doc-source-code>

  <h3>2. Add the button component to your project:</h3>
  <doc-source-code
    language="bash"
    code="ng g ngverse:element button"
  ></doc-source-code>

  <p>
    This command adds the full source code for the button component to your
    project. It behaves just as if you had created it yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Zoneless:</strong> We don't rely on <code>zone.js</code>. All
      elements are zoneless, meaning they will work regardless of whether your
      app includes <code>zone.js</code> or not.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fully Customizable:</strong> The complete source code is yours, so
      it is 100% customizable.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Accessibility:</strong> We prioritize accessibility, including
      features like keyboard navigation and focus management. Generated
      components have these behaviors by default.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Modular Approach:</strong> You only add what you need. No
      unnecessary components or features are bundled into your project.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why this approach?</h2>

  <p>
    If youâ€™ve extensively used UI libraries, you might wonder why NgVerse took
    this approach. The reasons are rooted in three major concerns:
  </p>

  <h3>1. Customization</h3>

  <p>
    UI libraries often have limited customization options. For example, if you
    want a fully-featured select component with single/multi-selection, keyboard
    navigation, and other advanced features, building it from scratch can be
    time-consuming and error-prone. So, you might turn to a library like Angular
    Material.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, you may soon realize that customizing Angular Material components
    is
    <strong>extremely difficult</strong> (you've probably faced this issue
    already). You might switch to a different library that offers more control,
    but let's say you want all your select components to include a clear icon
    beside the placeholder. No library may provide this feature. They might
    allow custom templates (<code>ng-template</code>), but now you have another
    issue:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Either you must use <code>ng-template</code> everywhere you use the select
      component.
    </li>
    <li>
      Or you need to wrap the libraryâ€™s select component in your own custom
      component (<code>app-select</code>) and modify it there.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This approach creates a wrapper component, which requires additional work to
    handle delegation and communication between your component and the libraryâ€™s
    component. You also risk not achieving full functionality.
  </p>

  <p>
    In <strong>NgVerse</strong>, when you add a select component, the complete
    source code is added to your project. By default, the component is already
    fully featured, with options for overlays, keyboard navigation,
    accessibility, single and multi-selection, and unit tests. If you want to
    add a clear icon, you simply modify the source code directly within your
    project.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Third-party Independence</h3>

  <p>
    NgVerse components evolve with your project. You donâ€™t have to wait for a
    third-party library to release an update to support a new Angular version,
    make the library zoneless, or fix critical bugs.
  </p>

  <p>
    You are in controlâ€”you decide what to upgrade and when. Your project won't
    be forced to upgrade just because a third-party library introduced new
    features in a newer Angular version.
  </p>

  <p>
    For large enterprise apps, <strong>being in control</strong> of your
    components is crucial. You can upgrade or maintain them as needed without
    waiting for external libraries to catch up.
  </p>

  <h3>3. No Global Configuration Theming</h3>

  <p>
    Most UI libraries require you to modify global styles to update the theme.
    Typically, you either:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Read through a large theming file.</li>
    <li>Inspect elements to find the correct selectors.</li>
    <li>Write CSS overrides in your global <code>styles.css</code> file.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    With <strong>NgVerse</strong>, each component comes with its own
    <code>component.css</code> file. If you want to update the style, you simply
    edit the componentâ€™s style file directly, keeping your components
    encapsulated.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is a lot more to say, but enough wordsâ€”itâ€™s time to fly! ðŸš€ Letâ€™s get
    started.
