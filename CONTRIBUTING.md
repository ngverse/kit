Thank you for your willingness to contribute ðŸš€.

### <a name="submit-pr"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [ngverse](https://github.com/lukonik/ngverse) repo.

2. In your forked repository, make your changes in a new git branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch main
   ```

3. Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.

4. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our [commit message conventions](#commit).
   Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

   ```shell
   git commit --all
   ```

   Note: the optional commit `--all` command line option will automatically "add" and "rm" edited files.

5. Push your branch to GitHub:

   ```shell
   git push origin my-fix-branch
   ```

6. In GitHub, send a pull request to `ngverse:main`.

### Reviewing a Pull Request

#### Addressing review feedback

If we ask for changes via code reviews then:

1. Make the required updates to the code.

2. Create a fixup commit and push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):

   ```shell
   git commit --all --fixup HEAD
   git push
   ```

   For more info on working with fixup commits see [here](./contributing-docs/using-fixup-commits.md).

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

##### Updating the commit message

A reviewer might often suggest changes to a commit message (for example, to add more context for a change or adhere to our [commit message guidelines](#commit)).
In order to update the commit message of the last commit on your branch:

1. Check out your branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout my-fix-branch
   ```

2. Amend the last commit and modify the commit message:

   ```shell
   git commit --amend
   ```

3. Push to your GitHub repository:

   ```shell
   git push --force-with-lease
   ```

> NOTE:<br />
> If you need to update the commit message of an earlier commit, you can use `git rebase` in interactive mode.
> See the [git docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode) for more details.

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes from the main (upstream) repository:

- Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

  ```shell
  git push origin --delete my-fix-branch
  ```

- Check out the main branch:

  ```shell
  git checkout main -f
  ```

- Delete the local branch:

  ```shell
  git branch -D my-fix-branch
  ```

- Update your local `main` with the latest upstream version:

  ```shell
  git pull --ff upstream main
  ```

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Format

_This specification is inspired by and supersedes the [AngularJS commit message format][commit-message-format]._

We have very precise rules over how our Git commit messages must be formatted.
This format leads to **easier to read commit history**.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The `header` is mandatory and must conform to the [Commit Message Header](#commit-header) format.

The `body` is mandatory for all commits except for those of type "docs".
When the body is present it must be at least 20 characters long and must conform to the [Commit Message Body](#commit-body) format.

The `footer` is optional. The [Commit Message Footer](#commit-footer) format describes what the footer is used for and the structure it must have.

#### <a name="commit-header"></a>Commit Message Header

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  â”‚       â”‚             â”‚
  â”‚       â”‚             â””â”€â«¸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  â”‚       â”‚
  â”‚       â””â”€â«¸ Commit Scope: button,input etc.
  â”‚
  â”‚
  â””â”€â«¸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test
```

The `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the `(<scope>)` field is optional.

<!-- This is an example tag in Markdown -->

example: fix(button): display loader while loading is true

##### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: Github Actions, SauceLabs)
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

##### Scope

The scope is optional, but in most cases, you will know what the scope is, so you should provide it. You can find scopes in [commitlint.config.js](./commitlint.config.js)

##### Summary

Use the summary field to provide a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

#### <a name="commit-body"></a>Commit Message Body

Just as in the summary, use the imperative, present tense: "fix" not "fixed" nor "fixes".

Explain the motivation for the change in the commit message body. This commit message should explain _why_ you are making the change.
You can include a comparison of the previous behavior with the new behavior in order to illustrate the impact of the change.

#### <a name="commit-footer"></a>Commit Message Footer

The footer can contain information about breaking changes and deprecations and is also the place to reference GitHub issues, Jira tickets, and other PRs that this commit closes or is related to.
For example:

```
BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change summary>
<BLANK LINE>
<breaking change description + migration instructions>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Fixes #<issue number>
```

or

```
DEPRECATED: <what is deprecated>
<BLANK LINE>
<deprecation description + recommended update path>
<BLANK LINE>
<BLANK LINE>
Closes #<pr number>
```

Breaking Change section should start with the phrase `BREAKING CHANGE: ` followed by a summary of the breaking change, a blank line, and a detailed description of the breaking change that also includes migration instructions.

Similarly, a Deprecation section should start with `DEPRECATED: ` followed by a short description of what is deprecated, a blank line, and a detailed description of the deprecation that also mentions the recommended update path.

### Revert commits

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit.

The content of the commit message body should contain:

- information about the SHA of the commit being reverted in the following format: `This reverts commit <SHA>`,
- a clear description of the reason for reverting the commit message.
